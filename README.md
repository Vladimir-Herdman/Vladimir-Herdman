### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vladimir!

I'm a Computer Science major at [Ohio Northern University](https://www.onu.edu/").

I put here any projects I've worked on, the ones I'm especially proud of are my Python
[QR Code Generator](https://github.com/Vladimir-Herdman/QR-Code-Generator-Gui) and my
[Canvas Grades Getter](https://github.com/Vladimir-Herdman/Canvas_Grade_Getter), but that's mostly
because I use them the most for some personal club activites, so check out my repositories
for all the ones I'm working on.

I'm always looking to learn more, so if you have any tips for me, or see something I could
improve in one of my projects, send me a message at vovaherdman@gmail.com, or leave an issue
message directly on the repository.

I also run Cross Country and Track in my free time, so come run sometime!
