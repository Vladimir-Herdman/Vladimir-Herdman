### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vladimir!

I'm a Computer Science major at [Ohio Northern University](https://www.onu.edu/").

I put here any projects I've worked on, the ones I'm especially proud of would be my current
[terminal chess](https://github.com/Vladimir-Herdman/terminal-chess) project and my
[QR Code Generator](https://github.com/Vladimir-Herdman/QR-Code-Generator-Gui) wrapper, but that's mostly
because I use them for some personal sports and club activities, so check out my page and full
repositories list to see what else I've worked on.

I'm always looking to learn more, so if you have any tips for me, or see something I could
improve in one of my projects, send me a message at vovaherdman@gmail.com, or leave an issue
message directly on the repository.
