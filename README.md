### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vladimir!

I'm a Computer Science major at [Ohio Northern University](https://www.onu.edu/").

I put here any projects I've worked on, the ones I'm especially proud of are my Python
[CLI tool](https://github.com/Vladimir-Herdman/Pace-Calculator) and my
[QR Code Generator](https://github.com/Vladimir-Herdman/QR-Code-Generator-Gui), but that's mostly
because I use them for some personal sports and club activities, so check out my [repositories
organizer README](https://github.com/Vladimir-Herdman/repository-list) for an organized list of all my projects.

I'm always looking to learn more, so if you have any tips for me, or see something I could
improve in one of my projects, send me a message at vovaherdman@gmail.com, or leave an issue
message directly on the repository.
